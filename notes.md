**Summary**: A blockchain-based system for p2p trading of small quantities of electricity between consumers and prosumers.

### Current system (assumptions)

1. There is an intermediary handling all the transactions at the moment
2. There is a physical infrastructure that is either managed by the very same intermediary or a closely related entity
3. Doing small transactions is pointless economically, because transaction feas are relatively high.

### The benefits of new system

1. makes it easier for smaller parties like households to participate more in the power market
2. address the problem of a single point of failure of transaction handling

### General discussion

Luisa mentioned at some point the problem of selling power to neighbours:

> But I'd have to sell it to a utility (in germany for a constant rate for it's lifetime)... I couldn't just sell it to my neighbour.

I wonder why that is the case. Is it because there is not infrastructure to sell power directly to someone else? Or maybe the law is out-dated and in order to sell power you have to register your power plant, which could be a difficult process? Probably both
