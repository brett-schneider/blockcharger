# Abstract
We propose a charging station for electric devices available to the general public that can be installed at any house so that there is a dense charging infrastructure, e.g. for electric vehicles

# requirements
- the recipient needs a client capable of using our protocol to purchase electricity
- the provider needs a client capable â€¦
- the provider needs a power outlet that powers the station and electricity to sell

# what we need to do:
- program a smart contract that monitors electricity dispensed and manages token flow
- token exchange    
  - ours
  - anyone can exchange tokens
- configure station price?
- Program clients for car and station

# todos:
- timeline
- diagram
- more text in abstract
